        <p>*Contains Spoilers</p>
<p>I happen to be a big fan of both, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_potter" target="_blank">Harry Potter</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotr" target="_blank">LOTR</a>. Both are legendary novels and they have written few chapters that can never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Lets see few of the similarities in both the  plots</p>
<!--more-->

<p>a) Both the movies have a <em>super-powerful</em> villain (Lord Voldemort/Dark Lord Sauron ), who  was extremely powerful in the past, weakened (but not finished) due to some happenings and is trying to come back to power.</p>
<p>If he comes back&#8230;.. it would be impossible to stop him(from wrongdoings)</p>
<p>So the aim is to not allow him to come to power</p>
<p>b) In both the movies, the required task could only be done by a particular <em>bunch</em> of people (Harry, Ron, Hermione/Frodo, Sam ). No other can do it!!</p>
<p>c) There is only one way to defeat the Villain (Destroy all the <em>Horcruxes</em>/Destroy the <em>One Ring</em>) and he already knows about it.</p>
<p>d) There is a <em>wise-person</em> in both the novels (Professor Dumbledore/Gandalf the Grey ), Who knows all  and  does not seem to make a mistake ever.</p>
<p>e) The protogonists (Harry, Ron, Hermione/ Frodo, Sam) are way too weak for the Villain ( Lord Voldemort/Dark Lord Sauron), but only they can face/fail him.</p>
<p>f) Though the <em>wise-person</em> is perfect (and an <em>almost</em> equal match for the villain), he cannot destroy/defeat the villain. His role is limited only to guidance/strategy making.</p>
