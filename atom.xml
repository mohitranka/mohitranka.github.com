    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>From our own experience designing and operating a highly available, highly scalable ecommerce platform, we have come to realize that relational databases should only be used when an application really needs the complex query, table join and transaction capabilities of a full-blown relational database. In all other cases, when such relational features are not needed, a NoSQL database service like DynamoDB offers a simpler, more available, more scalable and ultimately a lower cost solution.</p></blockquote>

<pre><code>            — Werner Vogels, CTO Amazon.com on when to use RDBMS
</code></pre>

<p>I came across this quote in <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2013/03/dynamodb-one-year-later.html">an article</a> while researching DynamoDB. As much as I respect Werner, I would suggest take his recommendation on the criteria on database selection with a pinch of salt, due to the obvious conflict of interest — He has a <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">database</a> to sell.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Most products do not need the <em>scale</em>, which cannot be served by relational databases. Relational databases have survived more than 20 years and still doing well, even at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MySQLatFacebook">large scale</a>! There are <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/">extremely</a> <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">mature</a> open source rdbms, requirement independent schemas, optimized queries for filtering, aggregation and list of data, great communities, acquired knowledge, default integration with programming frameworks and lots of tools developed.</p>

<h2>RDBMS are great-for-all, unless&hellip;</h2>

<p>Relational systems are super easy to work with, have great (free) tools for monitoring, backup, operations available, work well for most of the use cases, there is a lot of help (community, web resources, consulting) around and best of all.. you already know it well. <em>Unless</em> I have the following requirements I would use a single node relational database.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Super high availability</h3></li>
</ul>


<p>Relational database&rsquo;s server process is a single point of failure, which means your system <em>will</em> go down, when the process crashes or taken down for scheduled or unscheduled maintainence.</p>

<p>If you are building a system which needs to have close to 100% availability, look into clustered relational databases or distributed databases which choose availability over consistency, eg. cassandra.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Flexible schema</h3></li>
</ul>


<p>One of relational databases&#8217; great strength is its schema, data model and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization">related concepts</a>, which allow for schema modelling, without knowing the query patterns in advance, and works well. However, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model">not all data can be effectively represented in relational data model</a>. Relational databases are efficitent on fixed schema, with known columns and indexes, which can confirm to normalization rules for a tradeoff between consistency and performance. Flexible schema <a href="http://karwin.blogspot.in/2009/05/eav-fail.html">do</a> <a href="http://tonyandrews.blogspot.in/2004/10/otlt-and-eav-two-big-design-mistakes.html">not</a> <a href="https://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/opinion-pieces/bad-carma/">work well</a> with relational databases.</p>

<p>If you <em>need</em> (do you, really?) flexible schema, look at other nosql options.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Horizontal scaling</h3></li>
</ul>


<p>If you are looking to build a system that should scale horizontally as your data needs grow, a single-node relational database will not suffice forever. There is only so much room to grow, so much RAM and CPU to throw on a single machine. Sooner or later, you will hit that single server machine limit. At that point, you will have to either choose a NoSQL solution or a relational database system cluster.</p>

<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<p>NoSQL is no panacea and RDBMS are still the best choice for most of the applications. Unless you have strong need to <em>not</em> used a relational database, stick to it.</p>

    <link href="http://mohitranka.com/blog/one-click-website-deployment-with-octopress/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-20T00:13:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://mohitranka.com/blog/one-click-website-deployment-with-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been thinking to revamp the site for quite sometime and finally got around it. The old version was hosted on github, courtesy github pages which was a fairly simple one page setup, with links to my blog, github repository etc. For the new site, I needed to have one place to maintain the blogposts and webpages, so I started looking for jekyll style static page generators so that I can keep using github for hosting (for free! :D ) and really liked what <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> had to offer.</p>

<p>I have the website hosted on mohitranka.github.com (see <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator">here</a> on how to do it and mohitranka.com is merely a CNAME for it).</p>

<h2>Hello Octopress!</h2>

<p>Octopress is a blogging framework written on top of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It has nifty little commands to create new pages and posts using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>, growing number of <a href="http://octopressthemes.com/">themes and plugins</a>, which are everything you need for your static content based website.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>On your Ubuntu 13.04 machine, the following commands will let you publish your first page and blog post from octopress to github!</p>

<h3>Install Git</h3>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install git</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Install RVM to use ruby 1.9.3</h3>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
</span><span class='line'>sudo rvm install 1.9.3
</span><span class='line'>sudo rvm use 1.9.3
</span><span class='line'>sudo rvm rubygems latest</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Add the rvm to ~/.bashrc</h3>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Setup Octopress</h3>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git my-website
</span><span class='line'>cd my-website    # If you use RVM, You'll be asked if you trust the .rvmrc file (say yes).
</span><span class='line'>ruby --version  # Should report Ruby 1.9.3</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Install Octopress dependencies</h3>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo gem install bundler
</span><span class='line'>sudo bundle install</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Install the default Octopress theme</h3>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake install</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Point Octopress to talk to username.github.io</h3>

<p>You need to have machine&rsquo;s SSH public key added to your github account for this. See <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">this</a> on how to do it.</p>

<p>Once your SSH public key is added and machine&rsquo;s access to your github account has been validated, run the following commands.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cd /path/to/my-website
</span><span class='line'>rake setup_github_pages</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This asks for your github repository. Type (quotes for clarity only) &ldquo;git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git&rdquo; and hit return key. Now, you are ready to make deploy your site to github. well&hellip; almost!</p>

<h3>One-click (well.. command) settings.</h3>

<p>Put the following aliases in your ~/.bashrc file.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>alias deploy_site='rake clean && rake generate && rake deploy'
</span><span class='line'>alias preview_site='rake clean && rake generate && rake preview'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Install a new theme</h3>

<p>I am not a big fan of the default theme, so I looked around. I really liked mattgemmell.com, so I &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; myself to use the same theme he used!</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cd /path/to/my-website
</span><span class='line'>git submodule add https://github.com/rastersize/BlogTheme.git .themes/BlogTheme
</span><span class='line'>git submodule update --init
</span><span class='line'>rake install\[BlogTheme\]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And voila! Our website uses a new theme now</p>

<h3>Create a new post</h3>

<p>Run the following commands to create a new blog post. You can use new_page command to create a new page instead, as well.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cd /path/to/my-website
</span><span class='line'>rake new_post["My first post using Octopress"]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is create a file named &lsquo;/path/to/my-website/source/_posts/yyyy-mm-dd-my-first-post-using-octopress.markdown&rsquo;. You can refer markdown documentation on how to format it or use a WYSIWYG to Markdown editor. I suggest using <a href="http://personal-editor.com/">http://personal-editor.com/</a> if you are not comfortable with markdown.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>echo "My first post content" >> /path/to/my-website/source/_posts/yyyy-mm-dd-my-first-post-using-octopress.markdown</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will write a line of content in the newly created blog post.</p>

<h3>Preview the website</h3>

<p>Remember we put few aliases in ~/.bashrc? We can now use them to preview and publish the content using those commands</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cd /path/to/my-website
</span><span class='line'>preview_site</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can point your browser to <a href="http://localhost:4000">http://localhost:4000</a> to see the website homepage. You can see the blog post we just wrote at <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/yyyy/mm/dd/my-first-post-using-octopress/.">http://localhost:4000/blog/yyyy/mm/dd/my-first-post-using-octopress/.</a> Modify the markdown file, save, reload browser to see the update in the preview, repeat till you are happy with the finished article.</p>

<h3>Deploying the website</h3>

<p>Whenever you have made any change in the website (added a new blog post, deleted an existing page, modified content or stylesheet etc.), you can run the the following command to deploy the changes live to your github hosting!</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cd /path/to/my-website
</span><span class='line'>deploy_site</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And thats it! In few minutes after deployment, github will start showing the updated content on your live site!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[    <p>Someone much smarter, much experienced than me, told me this once. This is something I think contains immense wisdom and real world experience, which I feel needs to be shared with other too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family:arial;border-collapse:collapse;font-style:italic;">Working at a start-up requires an irrational amount of commitment. This either comes from the love of the vision, or love of the team, or love of the work you&#8217;re doing, or all of the above, or something more irrational than any of the above. A start-up does not pay well, cannot manage well, and has process gaps that are inanely obvious, and other things that one rationally expects. Start-ups do not lack the understanding or appreciation to solve these problems, but lack the luxury to spend time on those important things because of other more important things. Only when you dissolve yourself in the start-up as an owner (not an employee) does it start making sense, and every problem is seen as one you need to fix and not something that the company needs to fix for you.</span></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[    <p>Its 2.00 in the moring right now and my boss is going to rip me apart if I am late for office another day. I am just off from watching one of the most dramatic football final, you would ever see, and cannot resist the complusion to write something about it.</p>
<p>The confenderation cup 2009, South Africa final between Brzail and United States just ended with brazil snatching a 3 - 2 Victory, after being 0-2 down after the first half. It made me wonder how many teams in the world would be able to do that? Coming from being after being favoriates , bogged down by the minnows in the big match final. What would Dunga (Brazil coach) had said to them&nbsp; in the locker room, in the break, and how&nbsp; well the players responded.</p>
<p>Being a champion is something much more different than having the skills, the talent and putting the acts together.</p>
<p>It is about trulely believing in your abilities, in realizing that second best is no good, in giving everything you&#8217;ve got, in understanding &#8220;it has to be done&#8221;, its about not even thinking of giving up for even a single second, its about realizing your own potential, its about realizing you are a champion, its about your willingness to succeed, its about your ability to maintain your poise in tough situation, its about the character.</p>
<p>Brazil may have not pull off another victory EVER after being down in the second half, but the truth is, the fact is they are the champions today, and deserving ones.</p>

    <updated>2007-10-19T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://mohitranka.com/blog/harry-potter-vs-lotr</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[*Contains Spoilers

I happen to be a big fan of both, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_potter" target="_blank">Harry Potter</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotr" target="_blank">LOTR</a>. Both are legendary novels and they have written few chapters that can never be forgotten.

Lets see few of the similarities in both the  plots

<!--more-->

a) Both the movies have a <em>super-powerful</em> villain (Lord Voldemort/Dark Lord Sauron ), who  was extremely powerful in the past, weakened (but not finished) due to some happenings and is trying to come back to power.

If he comes back&#8230;.. it would be impossible to stop him(from wrongdoings)

So the aim is to not allow him to come to power

b) In both the movies, the required task could only be done by a particular <em>bunch</em> of people (Harry, Ron, Hermione/Frodo, Sam ). No other can do it!!

c) There is only one way to defeat the Villain (Destroy all the <em>Horcruxes</em>/Destroy the <em>One Ring</em>) and he already knows about it.

d) There is a <em>wise-person</em> in both the novels (Professor Dumbledore/Gandalf the Grey ), Who knows all  and  does not seem to make a mistake ever.

e) The protogonists (Harry, Ron, Hermione/ Frodo, Sam) are way too weak for the Villain ( Lord Voldemort/Dark Lord Sauron), but only they can face/fail him.

f) Though the <em>wise-person</em> is perfect (and an <em>almost</em> equal match for the villain), he cannot destroy/defeat the villain. His role is limited only to guidance/strategy making.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[I always wonder what makes people successful ? I dont know if such &#8216;Formula&#8217; exists. I have seen this world,well not much. 20 years are too less to know any thing about this world. but i always get the feeling(from what i have seen) that most deserving people are not always the most successful ones, sucess eludes them from one reason or another. what could it be??<!--more-->

I dont know, I am not successful either. one thing i know for sure that successful people hardly make any blunders.They know what to do well before it actually has to be done.They are planners,people who change the face of the world, or atleast their life, by planning. I might sound cliched, these all are the good qualities,talent,intelligence, hardwork etc. So whats the difference? lots of people have these qualities,they all are not successful.

Surely, Not all deserving people get what they deserve, The reason, so simple&#8230;.. they do not deserve it! Yes,they have one &#8216;weakness&#8217; or another which negates their qualities. Its just they do not realize it for most of the times and remain unsucessful.

I have one mind, i can think in a particular way.but my way is not necessarily correct.If you have any comments about my blog,please post them! it will help me learn this world better.

&#8211;Thanks
