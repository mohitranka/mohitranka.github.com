        <p><strong>Series A–C, post-MVP startups.</strong> Teams where the architecture, infra, or reliability is
            slowing growth.</p>
        <p><strong>B2B SaaS or AI-enabled products.</strong> Companies needing to scale their systems to support
            real-world usage and AI features.</p>
        <p><strong>Founder/CTO/VP Eng buyers.</strong> Leaders looking for high-leverage architectural guidance without

            <h3>Scale Architecture Redesign</h3>
            <p>For startups that have outgrown their MVP. I review your current architecture and design a scalable,
                pragmatic v2/v3 that can handle the next 10× of growth without a full rewrite.</p>

        <div class="service-card">
            <h3>Reliability & SLO Foundation</h3>
            <p>I help you define SLOs, improve observability, and harden your systems so incidents become rare and
                predictable instead of constant firefighting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-card">
            <h3>AI Product Readiness Review</h3>
            <p>I evaluate whether your data, infra, and architecture can reliably support AI features (retrieval,
                latency, iteration) and provide a concrete roadmap.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; max-width: 700px;">
        I am a <strong>Fractional Principal Architect (Infra, Reliability & AI Systems)</strong> helping post-MVP /
        Series A–C startups.
        <br><br>
        With background at LinkedIn, Postman, and Booking.com, I focus on architecture, infrastructure, and reliability.
        I do <strong>not</strong> act as a day-to-day engineering manager or sprint babysitter. My engagements are
        short, high-leverage, and focused on systems design and technical strategy.
