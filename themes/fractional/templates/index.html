    <h2>About</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; max-width: 700px;">
        I help post-revenue startups solve specific scaling problems: fixing messy data infrastructure, transitioning
        from MVPs to distributed systems, and structuring engineering teams. I remain hands-on with code (Python/Golang)
        while leading high-level strategy.
