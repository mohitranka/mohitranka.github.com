The importance of meeting and interacting with smart people is highly understated. One get immense influence of such people&#8217;s with their tiniest interaction.

I recently get the opportunity to have a conversation with such, one of the <em>more</em> enlightened person. We came up discussing about the some business process, and I got some information from him, in which I saw an exciting opportunity and idea and as he said, &#8220;Its all about capitalizing on the opportunity, as it present itself&#8221;

About the idea, I will hopefully write soon&#8230; :)

Till then&#8230;.. So long :)
