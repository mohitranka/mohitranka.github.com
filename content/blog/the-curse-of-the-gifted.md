<blockquote>&#8220;See, we&#8217;ve seen the curse of the gifted before.  Some of us were those kids in college.  We learned the hard way that the bill always comes due &#8211; the scale of the problems always increases to a point where your native talent alone doesn&#8217;t cut it any more.  The smarter you are, the longer it takes to hit that crunch point &#8211; and the harder the adjustment when you finally do.  And we can see that *you*, poor damn genius that you are, are cruising for a serious bruising.&#8221;</blockquote>
- Eric S. Raymond to Linus Torvalds in his essay &#8220;The curse of the gifted programmer&#8221;
