    <p>Had a WTF moment yesterday after spending around 2 hours debugging a UI bug very-very late in the night, only to realize just before rewriting the entire UI component it was due to a minor typo, resulting in very wierd behaviour,just before the deadline.</p>
<p>The day ended with me fixing the bug with removing one character, down 200 bucks on dinner in the office, tired with just 2 hours of sleep in last 48 hours and a laptop that does not boot&#8230;.. yet with a positive feeling, something which I dont seem to have much nowadays and few questions to myself, about which I better find answers soon.</p>
<p>All in a work&#8217;s day!</p>
