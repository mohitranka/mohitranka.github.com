<p>The confenderation cup 2009, South Africa final between Brzail and United States just ended with brazil snatching a 3 - 2 Victory, after being 0-2 down after the first half. It made me wonder how many teams in the world would be able to do that? Coming from being after being favoriates , bogged down by the minnows in the big match final. What would Dunga (Brazil coach) had said to them&nbsp; in the locker room, in the break, and how&nbsp; well the players responded.</p>
<p>Being a champion is something much more different than having the skills, the talent and putting the acts together.</p>
<p>It is about trulely believing in your abilities, in realizing that second best is no good, in giving everything you&#8217;ve got, in understanding &#8220;it has to be done&#8221;, its about not even thinking of giving up for even a single second, its about realizing your own potential, its about realizing you are a champion, its about your willingness to succeed, its about your ability to maintain your poise in tough situation, its about the character.</p>
<p>Brazil may have not pull off another victory EVER after being down in the second half, but the truth is, the fact is they are the champions today, and deserving ones.</p>
